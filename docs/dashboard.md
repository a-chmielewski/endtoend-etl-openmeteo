# :bar_chart: Weather Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

The Metabase dashboard provides interactive, self-service analytics for exploring weather patterns across multiple European cities. Built on top of dbt-transformed dimensional models, it delivers real-time insights with filtering and drill-down capabilities.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Technical Implementation

### Data Source

The dashboard queries the `fct_city_day` dimensional model created by dbt:

```sql
-- Simplified view of the underlying data model
SELECT 
    city,
    date,
    temperature_avg,
    temperature_min,
    temperature_max,
    precipitation_sum,
    wind_speed_max
FROM analytics.fct_city_day
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY date DESC, city;
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Pre-aggregated data**: Daily aggregations computed once by dbt, not on every query
- **Indexed columns**: Database indexes on `city` and `date` for fast filtering
- **Materialized tables**: dbt materializes marts as tables, not views
- **Query caching**: Metabase caches results for improved response times

## :gear: Dashboard Configuration

### Metrics Displayed

| Metric | Calculation | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Avg Temperature** | `AVG(temperature_2m)` | Central tendency of daily temps |
| **Min Temperature** | `MIN(temperature_2m)` | Daily low for cold analysis |
| **Max Temperature** | `MAX(temperature_2m)` | Daily high for heat analysis |
| **Total Precipitation** | `SUM(precipitation)` | Daily rainfall accumulation |
| **Max Wind Speed** | `MAX(wind_speed_10m)` | Peak wind conditions |

### Filter Options

- **Date Range**: Select custom start and end dates
- **City**: Choose one or more cities (Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, London)
- **Time Granularity**: Daily aggregations (can be extended to hourly)

## :rocket: Setting Up the Dashboard

### 1. Access Metabase

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after running the Docker stack.

### 2. Connect to Database

**PostgreSQL Connection Settings:**
```
Host: postgres
Port: 5432
Database: analytics
Username: analytics
Password: <your_password>
```

### 3. Create Visualizations

!!! tip "Dashboard Creation"
    1. Click **New** ‚Üí **Question**
    2. Select the `fct_city_day` table
    3. Choose visualization type (line chart, table, etc.)
    4. Add filters for interactivity
    5. Save to dashboard

### 4. Share & Embed

Metabase supports:

- **Public links** for sharing outside the platform
- **Embedded dashboards** in web applications
